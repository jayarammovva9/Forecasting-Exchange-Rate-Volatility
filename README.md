## File Structure

•⁠  ⁠⁠ main_analysis.ipynb ⁠: The main Colab notebook containing all data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ final_predictors_2003_onwards.csv ⁠: The final, cleaned dataset used in the analysis.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ requirements.txt ⁠: A list of all Python packages required to run the code.

## How to Reproduce These Results

1.  *Clone the Repository:*
    ⁠ bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
     ⁠

2.  *Set Up the Environment:*
    ⁠ bash
    cd [YourRepoName]
    pip install -r requirements.txt
     ⁠

3.  *Run the Analysis:*
    Open the ⁠ main_analysis.ipynb ⁠ notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment. Run all cells from top to bottom. The code will load the local CSV file and generate all tables and figures from the paper.
